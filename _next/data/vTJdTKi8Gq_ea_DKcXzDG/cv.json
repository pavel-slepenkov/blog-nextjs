Solve business problems with code, low-code, no-code, and common sense. Able to elaborate business needs with users and stakeholders, analyze them, design the solution, build it, run in production, and adopt across the users. Proficient with several programming languages, especially with Python and JavaScript. I also have a solid experience in Salesforce.com as a developer and technical lead, which helps to decompose almost any business application and their data flows.\n            </p>\n        </td>\n        <td class=\"print-only contact-info-section\">\n            <div class=\"left-pinned contact-info\">▸ Krakow, Poland</div>\n            <div class=\"left-pinned contact-info\">▸ pavel.slepenkov@gmail.com | +48-571-087-630</div>\n            <div class=\"left-pinned contact-info\">▸ github.com/pavel-slepenkov | pavelslepenkov.info</div>\n            <div class=\"left-pinned contact-info\">▸ stackoverflow.com/users/798335</div>\n            <div class=\"left-pinned contact-info\">▸ linkedin.com/in/pavel-slepiankou</div>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<table class=\"table-no-borders no-print social-logos-section\">\n    <tr>\n        <td>\n            <a class=\"centered\"  href=\"https://www.github.com/pavel-slepenkov\" target=\"_blank\">\n                <img class=\"social-logo\" src=\"images/cv/github-social-logo.svg\" alt=\"github\">\n            </a>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            <a class=\"centered\" href=\"https://www.stackoverflow.com/users/798335/pavel-slepiankou\" target=\"_blank\">\n                <img class=\"social-logo\" src=\"images/cv/stack-exchange-symbol.svg\" alt=\"stackoverflow\">\n            </a>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            <a class=\"centered\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-slepiankou-76376b35\" target=\"_blank\">\n                <img class=\"social-logo\" src=\"images/cv/linkedin-logo-button.svg\" alt=\"linkedin\">\n            </a>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            <a class=\"centered\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pavel.slepiankou\" target=\"_blank\">\n                <img class=\"social-logo\" src=\"images/cv/facebook-logo-button.svg\" alt=\"blog\">\n            </a>\n        </td>\n    <tr>\n</table>\n<hr>\n","status":"publish","author":"pavel","excerpt":"","type":"page"},"skills":{"id":"skills","contentHtml":"<div class=\"section-header right-pinned\">KEY SKILLS</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Python</strong>: asyncio, funcy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Django</li>\n<li><strong>AWS</strong>: EC2, S3, Athena, Glue, Lambda, IAM and security</li>\n<li><strong>Databases</strong>: Snowflake, AWS Redshift, AWS RDS, Postgres, MSSQL, NoSQL</li>\n<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: Nodejs, ES6, React, Lightning Framework, AngularJS</li>\n<li><strong>Message Queues</strong>: Kafka, Celery+Redis</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced Analytical SQL</strong></li>\n<li><strong>ETL/ELT Tools</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache Airflow, Luigi, dbt</li>\n<li>In-house built ETL frameworks</li>\n<li>3rd party: Fivetran, StitchData, Pentaho, Salesforce related ETL (Dataloader, DBAmp)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Tableau</strong> and <strong>JupiterLab</strong></li>\n<li><strong>DevOps</strong> &#x26;
