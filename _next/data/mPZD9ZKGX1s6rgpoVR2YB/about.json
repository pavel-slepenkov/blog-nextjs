I build ETL tools from scratch and use a modern data engineering technology stack to get things spinning.</p>\n<p>Although, I have more than ten years of professional software development experience and more than twelve years of overall IT experience. During this time I worked with a wide range of technologies, some of which already retired, some thrives. I played many roles, including key developer, team leader, and system architect with different projects and companies. But with all these roles and responsibilities I'm still a developer who codes every single day. I'm a geek who's seeking new stuff in computers and networks just for fun and enjoys that.</p>\n<p>I'm an active member of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/798335/pavel-slepiankou\">StackOverflow / StackExchange communities</a>.\nI found that answering other people questions is a very fun and effective way to learn something new.</p>\n<p>Current technology stack:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ðŸ›  Python</li>\n<li>ðŸ›  Postgres / MSSQL</li>\n<li>ðŸ›  AWS: Redshift, S3, Lambda, RDS, EC2</li>\n<li>ðŸ›  Redis</li>\n<li>ðŸ›  Tableau</li>\n<li>ðŸ›  Node.js</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here're some of my public pages where you can get me know a little bit further</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://github.com/pavel-slepenkov'>GitHub</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://trailblazer.me/id/pslepiankou'>Salesforce Trailblazer</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-slepiankou-76376b35'>LinkedIn</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://pavel-slepenkov.github.io/'>CV</a></li>\n</ul>\n","status":"publish","author":"pavel","excerpt":"","type":"post"}},"__N_SSG":true}
