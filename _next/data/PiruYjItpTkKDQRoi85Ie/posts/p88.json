From my side it makes sense. End users likes such changes.</p>\n<p>So, the next what you will see it’s a drifting to simplifying an admin’s everyday tasks. The “Admin” section was moved to the top of the menu and the monitoring section was greatly improved, as it is very significant part for administrators as well as developers. Logs and Jobs gained their own small sections. I think that it’s a cool improvement for administrators, which should save many time at long-term perspective.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/blog.pavelslepenkov.info/improved+setup+interface/2013-07-23+12_02_26-Drawing1+-+Visio+Professional.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Change sets got dedicated section between <strong>Build</strong> and <strong>Monitor</strong> sections.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/blog.pavelslepenkov.info/improved+setup+interface/2013-07-24+06_10_57-Customize+~+salesforce.com+-+Enterprise+Edition.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>All this changes seems like a great work of UX team, from my side setup menu is admin tool and should be enhanced for admins, a professional developers who are work with really enterprise applications rarely looks to these screens, they stare into a code editor. It’s a reason why I didn’t find any significant changes into <strong>Build</strong> menu.</p>\n<p>Seems that’s all.</p>\n","title":"Overview of salesforce improved setup interface","date":"2013-07-23T12:06:55+01:00","status":"publish","permalink":"/?p=88","author":"pavel","excerpt":"","type":"post","category":["force.com"],"tag":["Summer '13","UX"],"post_format":[],"fplayout":["default"],"original_post_id":["88"],"dsq_thread_id":["5894537144"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
