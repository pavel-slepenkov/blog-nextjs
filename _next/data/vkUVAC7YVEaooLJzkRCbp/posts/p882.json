{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"p882","contentHtml":"<p>By default Salesforce provides just one billing and shipping address per account.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/p882/img1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>But your business might require a multiple billing/shipping addresses for single account. Based on my experience you have several options to fix that.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create new account for each billing/shipping details which you need and join it with main account via parent account field</strong>\nThis solution looks as most simple and anticipated way to meet this requirement. Usually single billing/shipping address is a single business entity and should be separated from other ones. But it might generate many “address only” accounts for some specific cases when your business operates with customers/partners who has a lot of addresses. It will create clutter in your account data. To fix that you might create a special record type and layout for these accounts in order to separate them and show only required data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create custom object to track just address details and link it with account via master detail field</strong>\nFor cases described above when you have a lot of an address only accounts an isolated custom object for storing address info might be preferable. Usually this object has <ps2>all the standard address fields</ps2> like city, postal code, etc. and <ps2>Type</ps2> picklist for distinction types like billing, shipping, warehouse, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create custom fields to track additional address details right on account</strong>\nThis solution is good when you absolutely sure that your accounts limited to 2 or 3 additional addresses and you can just define fields for these addresses like billing address line 1, billing address line 2 and so on. It might save some data space in your org. Also it’s convenient to have all information on a single page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Store all address info in some huge text field/attachment/file/etc. in JSON format (actually, any parsable format)</strong>\nThat’s really esoteric and geeky solution and included here just for completeness. It might be solution in some very specific cases when you have custom front-end and custom code which parse it to correct formats.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Look for App Exchange package which solve that</strong>\nI believe someone already solved this issue with some package and it might be a solution for you too.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n","title":"Multiple addresses for account in Salesforce","date":"2018-04-26T11:24:38+01:00","status":"publish","permalink":"/?p=882","author":"pavel","excerpt":"","type":"post","category":["Uncategorized"],"tag":["salesforce"],"post_format":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
