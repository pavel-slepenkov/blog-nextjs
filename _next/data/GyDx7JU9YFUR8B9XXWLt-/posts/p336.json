The main trouble is that during development we create a many relationships and dependencies between app’s components. As a result when you try to migrate it you meet a dependency hell. Today I have to install the old version of application which was frozen a half year ago to developer org (because a fresh dev. org have no any dependency while sandbox have all metadata from Production).</p>\n<p>The first step for such kind of migration is creation data model, because of all other components have a dependencies on data model. For this app I have to migrate 46 objects (both standard and custom).</p>\n<p>I’m trying to deploy it via Eclipse and got a pretty interesting and fully obfuscated error</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Error: objects/Account.object(Account):duplicate value found: &#x3C;unknown> duplicates value on record with id: &#x3C;unknown></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A quick investigation in Google provides the <a href=\"http://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/6063/object-deploy-fails-with-duplicate-value-found-unknown-duplicates-value-on\">answer</a> that the cause is enabled history tracking on object. And as a solution we should disable it on destination org and if it’s not a trouble and can take no more that 1 minute, the second part of the solution not seems such simple and clear. We need to disable a history tracking directly on object. So let’s investigate the object’s metadata file and try to find it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pavelslepenkov.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-01-19-12_35_03-force-com-lams_src_objects_loan__c-object-eclipse.png\"><img src=\"https://www.pavelslepenkov.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-01-19-12_35_03-force-com-lams_src_objects_loan__c-object-eclipse.png\" alt=\"2014-01-19 12_35_03-Force.com - lams_src_objects_Loan__c.object - Eclipse\"></a>Let’s disable it by setting this parameter to false and try to deploy it.
