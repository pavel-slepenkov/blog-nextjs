{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"p617","contentHtml":"<p>Sometimes Salesforce throws error messages which might to confound. It isn't depend on your seniority level as developer. As well as it isn't your fault, but just a very misleading message. Today I got the following error when was working with VisualForce page:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Formula Expression is required on the action attributes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hmm, I checked each expression, each button, a whole markup on the page. But found nothing. The markup was good. I double check the markup. And nothing was found again. So, I went deeper to Google and finally I found the answer. It was incredibly easy to find and very stupid from my side.</p>\n<p>So, there is an answer. You know that when you construct PageReference you have to do it in the following manner</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-java\"><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"token class-name\">PageReference</span> nextPage <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">PageReference</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'/apex/MyCoolVisualForcePage'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>But I made stupidly mistake in such simple place</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-java\"><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"token class-name\">PageReference</span> nextPage <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">PageReference</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'MyCoolVisualForcePage'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>It was fine for Salesforce on compilation level. But in runtime it crashed. Also you will find this error around if write in the such manner</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-java\"><code class=\"language-java\"><span class=\"token class-name\">PageReference</span> nextPage <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">PageReference</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'apex/MyCoolVisualForcePage'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>So, <strong>leading backslash is required in PageReference constructor</strong> and if you miss it Salesforce will punish you by really strange error message.</p>\n","title":"Fix for [Formula Expression is required on the action attributes] error","date":"2015-11-18T11:31:40+00:00","status":"publish","permalink":"/?p=617","author":"pavel","excerpt":"","type":"post","category":["Errors","force.com"],"tag":["apex","errors","exceptions","salesforce errors","visualforce"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
