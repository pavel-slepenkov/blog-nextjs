**Ant migration tool** for Force.com is incredible tool which widens your development and deployment abilities.

First of all there are the list of the benefits which it brings to you

- deployment via command line in fully automated mode
- running unit tests during deployment to sandbox
- using Continuous Integration server like Jenkins

Let's see deeply. You need to install [Apache Ant.](http://ant.apache.org/), after that you need to download migration tool from your Salesforce org by the following way: **Setup → Develop → Tools**, there is you can find a link to download. Next you just need to extract jar file into **lib** directory of ANT_HOME.

The next step is creation of build files and addition a connection information of your project to it. You can find the basic ant configuration [here](https://github.com/pavel-slepenkov/salesforce-ant-migration-tool-demo/tree/master/beginners-demo). This's GitHub repo where I collect Salesforce Ant Migration Tool configurations.

Here you can see the following structure
```
src/
build.properties
build.xml
```

This's basic structure for salesforce projects, where **src** directory was created by Eclipse and holds all metadata components in its own folders, and two files **build.xml** and **build.properties** which are generic for **Ant**.

**build.properties** is a file for a storing all configured properties, like username and password, urls, sandbox names, etc.

```bash
# build.properties
#
# Specify the login credentials for the desired Salesforce organization
sf.username = <Insert your Salesforce username here>
sf.password = <Insert your Salesforce password + Security Token here>
#sf.pkgName = <Insert comma separated package names to be retrieved>
#sf.zipFile = <Insert path of the zipfile to be retrieved>
#sf.metadataType = <Insert metadata type name for which listMetadata or bulkRetrieve operations are to be performed>

# Use ‘https://login.salesforce.com' for production or developer edition (the default if not specified).
# Use ‘https://test.salesforce.com for sandbox.
sf.serverurl = https://login.salesforce.com

sf.maxPoll = 20
```

**build.xml** is an Ant script which describes all possible build operations for your project. Below you can find the very basic ant script for Force.com.

```xml

<project name="Demo usage of Salesforce Ant Migration Tool" default="testDeploy" basedir="." xmlns:sf="antlib:com.salesforce">

<!– default properties –>
<property file="build.properties"/>
<property environment="env"/>
<property name="target" value="src" />

<target name="testDeploy">
    <!– Verify the abbility to upload the contents of the "src" package –>
    <sf:deploy username="${sf.username}" password="${sf.password}" serverurl="${sf.serverurl}" maxPoll="${sf.maxPoll}" deployRoot="src" checkOnly="true" runAllTests="true"/>
</target>

<target name="deploy">
    <!– Upload the contents of the "src" directory and run all test –>
    <sf:deploy username="${sf.username}" password="${sf.password}" serverurl="${sf.serverurl}" maxPoll="${sf.maxPoll}" deployRoot="scr" runAllTests="true">
    </sf:deploy>
</target>

<!– retriev metadata from org into local project folder src (by default), but it might be overridden in command line –>
<target name="retrieve" description="Retrieves metadata from ${sf.env} to ${target}" >
    <mkdir dir="${target}"/>
    <sf:retrieve username="${sf.username}${sf.env}" password="${sf.password}" serverurl="${sf.serverurl}" retrieveTarget="${target}" unpackaged="package.xml"/>
</target>

<!– Retrieve the information of all items of a particular metadata type –>
<target name="listMetadata">
    <sf:listMetadata username="${sf.username}" password="${sf.password}" serverurl="${sf.serverurl}" metadataType="${sf.metadataType}"/>
</target>

<!– Retrieve the information on all supported metadata type –>
<target name="describeMetadata">
    <sf:describeMetadata username="${sf.username}" password="${sf.password}" serverurl="${sf.serverurl}"/>
</target>

</project>

```

Here are 5 targets:

- testDeploy
- deploy
- retrieve
- listMetadata
- describeMetadata

In the start you need just the first two.

**testDeploy** allows you to test deployment without committing any changes into the cloud environment. With this operation you can verify stability of all metadata components which are described in **package.xml**. For basic project it will take less than 1 min, what is faster than such operation via Eclipse in a few times.

```bash
~$ ant testDeploy
```

When you finished with **testDeploy** and have got no error messages, you can go ahead with **deploy** task which allows you to deploy all metadata components into you org with running all unit tests.

```bash
~$ ant deploy
```

These are the main tasks which would be used everyday, the 3 next tasks are more rarely used, the first one is **retrieve** which allows you to download the latest version of metadata from salesforce, by default it goes to **src** directorey, but if you need to redirect it to another folder you can use command line parameters

```bash
~$ ant -Dtarget=retrieveResults retrieve
```
This command will download metadata into folder **retrieveResults** which should be at same level with **src** dirrectory.

The other two target allow to list metadata in the org and describe it. It might be that you do not need to use them at all.
