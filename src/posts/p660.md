Sometimes you can face a very bad situation when you got **REQUEST\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED** exception. You can find this exception in your debug logs, in the logs of any external applications which use API for integration, in developer console, etc.

It means that you’re blocked for any API calls. In the worst case you must wait for a 24 hours for resetting this limit. But usually all requests were not sent in the same time period thus limit will gone early. In this point you have to analyze what was the reason of the limit. Sometimes it’d be a single data loading operation and you’ll not face it in the future. But sometime you code reaches this limit everyday and you have to consider a code optimization or obtaining an additional API requests from Salesforce.
