By default Salesforce provides just one billing and shipping address per account.

But your business might require a multiple billing/shipping addresses for single account. Based on my experience you have several options to fix that.

1. **Create new account for each billing/shipping details which you need and join it with main account via parent account field**
  This solution looks as most simple and anticipated way to meet this requirement. Usually single billing/shipping address is a single business entity and should be separated from other ones. But it might generate many “address only” accounts for some specific cases when your business operates with customers/partners who has a lot of addresses. It will create clutter in your account data. To fix that you might create a special record type and layout for these accounts in order to separate them and show only required data.

2. **Create custom object to track just address details and link it with account via master detail field**
  For cases described above when you have a lot of an address only accounts an isolated custom object for storing address info might be preferable. Usually this object has <ps2>all the standard address fields</ps2> like city, postal code, etc. and <ps2>Type</ps2> picklist for distinction types like billing, shipping, warehouse, etc.

3. **Create custom fields to track additional address details right on account**
  This solution is good when you absolutely sure that your accounts limited to 2 or 3 additional addresses and you can just define fields for these addresses like billing address line 1, billing address line 2 and so on. It might save some data space in your org. Also it’s convenient to have all information on a single page.

4. **Store all address info in some huge text field/attachment/file/etc. in JSON format (actually, any parsable format)**
  That’s really esoteric and geeky solution and included here just for completeness. It might be solution in some very specific cases when you have custom front-end and custom code which parse it to correct formats.

5. **Look for App Exchange package which solve that**
  I believe someone already solved this issue with some package and it might be a solution for you too.
