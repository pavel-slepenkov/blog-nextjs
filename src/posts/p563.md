My most recent `.gitignore` from project which I had been working on a few years ago

```bash
# IntelliJ IDEA + Illuminated Cloud
.idea
IlluminatedCloud/
out
*.iml
# Sumlime
*.sublime-workspace
*.sublime-project
# VS Code
.vscode/
# SFDX
.sfdx/
# Node related stuff
node_modules/
package-lock.json
# Python virtual environment
venv/
# other stuff
*.cfg
config
build.properties
.project
salesforce.schema
.vim-force.com/
```

## 2015 version

Git is my favorite version control system with incredible collaboration platforms like GitHub or Bitbucket. Thus I’d like to share some Salesforce.com related config for Git

```bash
.project
.settings
.metadata
salesforce.schema
Referenced Packages
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-settings
*.sublime-workspace
apex-scripts/log
build.properties
config
mm.log
```

### Eclipse Related stuff
Eclipse Platform is a base for Salesforce.com Official IDE thus in Salesforce projects you can find many configuration things which should not be added to a repository.

- **.metadata** – This folder contains metadata information of Eclipse plugins
- **.project** – Eclipse projectsalesforce.schema – just a file-placeholder for Salesforce Schema tool in Eclipse which is working with SOQL.
- **Referenced Packages** – information about installed managed packages

### Mavensmate Related Stuff

During a past few years [Mavensmate](http://mavensmate.com/) tends to be a primary IDE for Force.com developers. This IDE works on top of Sublime Text editor (Atom is also supported), thus the following files and folders must be excluded from git repository:

The first 3 file extensions are self-explained

- **.sublime-project**
- **.sublime-settings**
- **.sublime-workspace**
- **config** – Mavensmate configuration
- **apex-scripts/log** – logs of execution Apex code from Mavensmate
- **mm.log**  – Mavensmate logs

### Apache Ant (Migration Tool) related stuff

**build.properties** – properties for Apache Ant which is used as a base for Salesforce.com Ant Migration Tool. This tool provides a build automation functionality. Especially for Force.com projects this file contains credentials and keys which should not be added into git repository.
