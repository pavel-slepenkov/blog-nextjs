I found this a few times in a different projects and now I’d share this common mistake with you.

```java
String someVariable = '';

// 50 lines of code between declaration and first use

for (Account acc: accounts) {
    someVariable = acc.Some_Field__c;
    // rest of the loop
}
```

Actually I really hate to find something like this in my codebase. What’s wrong with this code? Just one moment – the string variable which is on scope of for loop is declared outside of the for loop. That was an optimisation for some old compilers for C/C++ a many years ago. But modern compilers can optimise your code much better that you. So, just let them do that.

```java
for (Account acc: accounts) {
    String someVariable = acc.Some_Field__c;
    // rest of the loop
}
```

This code will be much effective that the first one. I did a few tests on Apex.

```java
String s1;
Datetime start = System.now();
for (Integer i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
    s1 = String.valueOf(i);
}
System.debug(System.now().getTime() – start.getTime());
```

with results:

USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|3006
USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|3029
USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|3189
USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|3256
USER_DEBUG [7]|DEBUG|3346

and run

```java
Datetime start = System.now();
for (Integer i = 0; i &amp;lt; 100000; i++) {
    String s1 = String.valueOf(i);
}
System.debug(System.now().getTime() – start.getTime());
```

with the following results:

USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|2954
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|2978
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|3102
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|3176
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|3205

Runs through 300.000 iterations:

**Variable declared outside the loop**
USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|8260
USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|8415
USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|8606
USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|8614
USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|8739
USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|8852
USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|8940

USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|9184
USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|9267
USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|9292
USER_DEBUG [6]|DEBUG|9461

**Variable declared inside the loop**
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|8093
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|8135
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|8448
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|8598
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|8785
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|8948
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|9032
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|9087
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|9122
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|9260
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|9330
USER_DEBUG [5]|DEBUG|9347

*\*Results was sorted for better readability*

As you can see the code which use a declaration of variables inside the loop works faster or with the same time of execution. But such code is much more supportable and readable.
