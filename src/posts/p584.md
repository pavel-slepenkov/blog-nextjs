Sometime when you deploy metadata to a newly created instance you can face some strange deployment issues. In this post I’ll try to collect such issues and solutions for it.

1. **Error: Could not resolve standard field’s name.**
  ----------------------------------------------------

This error means that a source salesforce org had enabled some features which was not enabled or unavailable in a destination org. You have to discover the official documentation for object field description.

For example I have got the following error

> objects/Account.object (Account.NaicsDesc) — Error: Could not resolve standard field’s name.

In the [documentation ](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_objects_account.htm) you can find that this field is related to **Data.com** feature


> This field is only available to organizations that use Data.com Prospector or Data.com Clean.


**Solution:** enable Data.com on destination org if possible or cut off the field from Account metadata xml




**this post will be updated as soon as I will get new errors**
