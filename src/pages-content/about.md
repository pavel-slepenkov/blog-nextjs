<ps1>Hi there, my name is Pavel Slepenkov and I'm a software developer from Minsk, Belarus</ps1>

My current primary specialization is data engineering and analysis with python, SQL and AWS stack. Although, I have more than 10 years of professional software development experience and more than 12 years of overall IT experience. During this period I used to work with a wide range of technologies, some of which already retired, some thriwes. Throughout this time I played a developer, key developer, team leader and system architect roles with different projects and companies. But with all these roles and responsibilities I still remain a developer who codes every single day. I'm still a geek who seeking for new interesting stuff in computers and networks just for fun, and I'm very proud of it.

I'm an active member of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/798335/pavel-slepiankou">StackOverflow / StackExchange communities</a>.
I found that answering other people questions is a very fun and effective way to learn something new.

I'm currently with <a href="https://www.apptio.com/">Apptio</a> and <a href="https://www.targetprocess.com">Apptio Targetprocess</a> as a senior BI/Data engineer. My main goal here is to provide data platform which improves and transforms business.
