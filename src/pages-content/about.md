<ps1>Hi there, my name is Pavel Slepenkov and I'm a software developer from Minsk, Belarus</ps1>

My current primary specialization is data engineering and analysis with python, SQL, and AWS stack. I build ETL tools from scratch and use a modern data engineering technology stack to get things spinning.

Although, I have more than ten years of professional software development experience and more than twelve years of overall IT experience. During this time I worked with a wide range of technologies, some of which already retired, some thrives. I played many roles, including key developer, team leader, and system architect with different projects and companies. But with all these roles and responsibilities I'm still a developer who codes every single day. I'm a geek who's seeking new stuff in computers and networks just for fun and enjoys that.

I'm an active member of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/798335/pavel-slepiankou">StackOverflow / StackExchange communities</a>.
I found that answering other people questions is a very fun and effective way to learn something new.

I'm currently with <a href="https://www.apptio.com/">Apptio</a> and <a href="https://www.targetprocess.com">Apptio Targetprocess</a> as a senior BI/Data engineer. My main goal here is to provide data platform which improves and transforms business.

Current technology stack:
ðŸ›  Python
ðŸ›  Postgres / MSSQL
ðŸ›  AWS: Redshift, S3, Lambda, RDS, EC2
ðŸ›  Redis
ðŸ›  Tableau
ðŸ›  Node.js
