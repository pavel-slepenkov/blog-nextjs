<ps1>Hello, my name is Pavel Slepenkov and I'm a software developer from Minsk, Belarus</ps1>

My primary specializations are Salesforce.com and data engineering/analysis with python and SQL. I have 10 years of professional software development experience and 12 years of overall IT experience. During this period I played developer, key developer, team leader and solution architect roles in different projects and companies. But with all these roles and responsibilities I still remain a developer who codes every single day. I'm still a geek who seeking for new interesting stuff in computers and networks just for fun. And I'm very proud of it.

I'm also an active member of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/798335/pavel-slepiankou">StackOverflow / StackExchange communities</a>.

I'm currently working for *Targetprocess* as a BI/data lead with deep business involvement. My main goal is to make all internal processes to be smart as much as possible.
