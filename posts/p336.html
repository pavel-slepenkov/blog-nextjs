<blockquote>
<p>Error: objects/Account.object(Account):duplicate value found: &#x3C;unknown> duplicates value on record with id: &#x3C;unknown></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick investigation in Google provides the <a href="http://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/6063/object-deploy-fails-with-duplicate-value-found-unknown-duplicates-value-on">answer</a> that the cause is enabled history tracking on object. And as a solution we should disable it on destination org and if it‚Äôs not a trouble and can take no more that 1 minute, the second part of the solution not seems such simple and clear. We need to disable a history tracking directly on object. So let‚Äôs investigate the object‚Äôs metadata file and try to find it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/p336/img1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs disable it by setting the parameter to false and try to deploy again. No luck, the same error has appeared. We need to investigate it more deeply - very quickly you will find that each field contains such prooperty and some of them are set to true. Let‚Äôs disable all. And try again.
Oh, this mysterious error didn‚Äôt disappear yet. We need to search any other properties for history tracking.
After thorough search and disabling any property related to history traching we can try to deploy it. Anddd... Error finally has disappeared.</p>
<p>Hope that this article will save a time for you.</p>
