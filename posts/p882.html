<p><img src="/images/p882/img1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But your business might require a multiple billing/shipping addresses for single account. Based on my experience you have several options to fix that.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Create new account for each billing/shipping details which you need and join it with main account via parent account field</strong>
This solution looks as most simple and anticipated way to meet this requirement. Usually single billing/shipping address is a single business entity and should be separated from other ones. But it might generate many ‚Äúaddress only‚Äù accounts for some specific cases when your business operates with customers/partners who has a lot of addresses. It will create clutter in your account data. To fix that you might create a special record type and layout for these accounts in order to separate them and show only required data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create custom object to track just address details and link it with account via master detail field</strong>
For cases described above when you have a lot of an address only accounts an isolated custom object for storing address info might be preferable. Usually this object has <ps2>all the standard address fields</ps2> like city, postal code, etc. and <ps2>Type</ps2> picklist for distinction types like billing, shipping, warehouse, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create custom fields to track additional address details right on account</strong>
This solution is good when you absolutely sure that your accounts limited to 2 or 3 additional addresses and you can just define fields for these addresses like billing address line 1, billing address line 2 and so on. It might save some data space in your org. Also it‚Äôs convenient to have all information on a single page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Store all address info in some huge text field/attachment/file/etc. in JSON format (actually, any parsable format)</strong>
That‚Äôs really esoteric and geeky solution and included here just for completeness. It might be solution in some very specific cases when you have custom front-end and custom code which parse it to correct formats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Look for App Exchange package which solve that</strong>
I believe someone already solved this issue with some package and it might be a solution for you too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
